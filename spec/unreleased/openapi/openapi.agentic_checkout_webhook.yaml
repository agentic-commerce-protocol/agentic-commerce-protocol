  version: "unreleased"

    Webhook receiver hosted by OpenAI to accept merchant order lifecycle events.

    ## Migration Notes

    The `EventDataOrder` schema now composes the full `Order` schema from the
    checkout spec via `$ref`. This means all Order fields (line_items,
    fulfillments, adjustments, totals, etc.) can be included in webhook payloads.

    The legacy `refunds[]` field has been removed. Use `adjustments[]` on the
    Order schema instead, which supports refunds, credits, returns, disputes,
    and more.

      description: |
        Merchants POST order events so ChatGPT can stay in sync with fulfillment-grade truth.
        Requests MUST be signed with an HMAC signature in the `Merchant-Signature` header.

        The `data` field MUST contain the full Order object (not incremental deltas).
        All optional Order fields (line_items, fulfillments, adjustments, totals) SHOULD
        be included when available.
