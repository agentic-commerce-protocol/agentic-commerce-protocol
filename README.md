The **Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP)** is an interaction model and open standard for connecting buyers, their AI agents, and businesses to complete purchases seamlessly.

The specification is [maintained](MAINTAINERS.md) by **OpenAI** and **Stripe** and is currently in `beta`.

- **For businesses** - Reach more customers. Sell to high-intent buyers by making your products and services available for purchase through AI agents—all while using your existing commerce infrastructure.
- **For AI Agents** - Embed commerce into your application. Let your users discover and transact directly with businesses in your application, without being the merchant of record.
- **For payment providers** - Grow your volume. Process agentic transactions by passing secure payment tokens between buyers and businesses through AI agents.

## 📅 Versioning

ACP uses **date-based versioning** in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. Each version represents a complete snapshot of the specification at that point in time.

### Version Structure

| Directory | Purpose |
| --------- | ------- |
| `spec/<version>/` | Complete spec snapshot for a released version |
| `spec/unreleased/` | Current development (not yet released) |
| `examples/<version>/` | Examples matching each spec version |
| `changelog/<version>.md` | Release notes for each version |

### Version Lifecycle

1. **unreleased/** - New features and changes are developed here
2. **Released** - When ready, `unreleased/` is snapshotted to a dated version (e.g., `2026-01-16/`)
3. **Deprecated** - Older versions remain available but are marked deprecated in the changelog

---

## 🛠 Getting Started

ACP has been **first implemented by both OpenAI and Stripe**, providing production-ready reference implementations for merchants and developers:

- [OpenAI Documentation](https://developers.openai.com/commerce/)
- [Stripe Agentic Commerce Documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/agentic-commerce)

To start building with ACP:

1. Review this repo's [OpenAPI specs](spec/2026-04-17/openapi/) and [JSON Schemas](spec/2026-04-17/json-schema/) for the latest stable version.
2. Choose a reference implementation:
   - Use OpenAI's implementation to integrate with ChatGPT and other AI agent surfaces.
   - Use Stripe's implementation to leverage its payment and merchant tooling.
3. Follow the guides provided in the linked documentation.
4. Test using the [examples](examples/2026-04-17/) provided in this repo.
